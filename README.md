# get-brotli-dictionary
[Brotli](https://github.com/google/brotli) is an excellent open source data compression library. (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli))
It has very good ratio for web object compression with using the embedded pre-defined 120 kilobyte dictionary derived from a large corpus.

This repository is stored a simple script to extract the dictionary from [RFC 7932](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7932) and the extracted dictionary binary file.

## usage example
[Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) is also an excellent open source data compression library what compress/decompress fastly.
It can use an external pre-defined dictionary.

```
$ wget github.com
$ zstd -19 index.html
index.html           : 23.66%   ( 56770 =>  13434 bytes, index.html.zst)
$ zstd -19 -D brotli.dic index.html
index.html           : 22.00%   ( 56770 =>  12492 bytes, index.html.zst) 
$ bro --input index.html | wc -c
11552
$ gzip -c index.html | wc -c
14049
```
notes: The brotli dictionary is not completely a byte stream but a complex word set and used with additional 120 word transformation rules. However zstd accept it as a pure byte stream.
